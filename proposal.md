**Email:** [Your Email Address]  
**Program:** Google Summer of Code 2025  
**Organization:** Accord Project  
**Project Title:** Enhancing Smart Legal Contract Protocols: Advancing the Accord Project Agreement Protocol (APAP)

---

## Abstract

The Accord Project Agreement Protocol (APAP) is a core framework that enables legally enforceable smart contracts by defining communication and transactional standards. This proposal aims to contribute to the APAP implementation by improving protocol design, ensuring robust message validation, and enhancing developer experience with better tooling and documentation.

---

## What Needs to Be Done

- Implement stateful validation and enforcement mechanisms for agreement messages in APAP.
- Develop and improve utilities for testing protocol compliance.
- Extend APAP with support for digital signatures, and non-repudiation.
- Build a web-based interactive tour for APAP showcasing contract lifecycles and message flows.
- Create developer-facing documentation and guides to ease integration.

---

## How

- **Research and Design:** Collaborate with mentors to finalize APAPâ€™s message flow and validation requirements.
- **Protocol Implementation:** Extend existing codebase to enforce message order, participant roles, and signature verification.
- **Frontend Web Tour:** Develop a React-based interface illustrating each stage of the APAP with interactive walkthroughs.
- **Testing and QA:** Write comprehensive tests and examples to validate protocol behavior.
- **Documentation:** Maintain well-organized markdown docs for all components and functionalities.

## Relevant Work Done

I contributed to the Accord Project in 2021 during GSoC by implementing digital signature capabilities in Cicero. My work included:

- Enhancing `cicero-core` to support signing and verifying contract templates.
- Developing a React web app to generate PKCS#12 keystores.
- Adding CLI commands for contract validation and signature verification.

## Learning Outcomes

- Deep understanding of distributed contract systems and protocol design.
- Advanced proficiency in TypeScript, JavaScript, and React for frontend development.
- Better familiarity with digital signature schemes, JSON Schema validation, and secure messaging practices.
- Improved documentation and testing practices for open-source contributions.

---

## Documentation

- I will update my progress weekly on a **public blog** or a **new GitHub repository**, including code snippets, visual walkthroughs, and learnings.
- If required by the mentor, a **Markdown file** explaining the APAP Web Tour and its functionalities will be created and maintained in the frontend repository.

## Availability

**Are you planning to vacation this summer?**  
No.

**How many hours per week do you expect to work on the project?**  
I plan to dedicate approximately **24-25 hours per week**:  
- **2 hours/day on weekdays**
- **7 hours/day on weekends**

## Future Work / After GSoC Ends

I plan to remain an active contributor to the Accord Project by continuing to:

- Review and submit pull requests to improve APAP and related libraries.
- Participate in community discussions and help onboard new contributors.
- Stay in touch with my mentor for long-term guidance and mentorship.
